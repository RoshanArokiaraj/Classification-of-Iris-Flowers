# Machine Learning Project : Iris-flower-classification

This project works to apply classification machine learning techniques and concepts to the datasets given by UCI Machine Learning Repository about Iris Flower Species data. This data includes roughly 50 samples from 3 separate species of Iris flowers. Features that were included were the a) length of the flower's petals b) width of the flower's petals c) length of the flower's sepals and d) width of the flower's sepals.
